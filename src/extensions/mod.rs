//! zshrs extensions — features zsh C does **not** have.
//!
//! This is the **only** sanctioned non-port directory in the tree
//! (alongside `src/recorder/`). Every file here implements
//! functionality that goes beyond upstream zsh: AOT compilation,
//! daemon coordination, autoload/script/plugin caches, fish-style
//! features (autosuggest, abbreviation expansion, syntax-highlight),
//! persistent worker pools, ZWC byte-code helpers used by the AOT
//! pipeline, etc. These have no corresponding C function and are not
//! expected to.
//!
//! Rules (see `docs/PORT.md` for the canonical statement):
//!
//!   1. Files here MUST implement a feature that zsh C demonstrably
//!      does **not** have. If a similar feature exists in zsh, port
//!      it instead — the port belongs under `src/ported/`.
//!   2. Files here MUST NOT duplicate or shadow any port. Extensions
//!      are additive only.
//!   3. The `port_purity` integration test exempts `src/extensions/`
//!      from the 1:1 file-existence rule on this basis.
//!
//! These submodules are also exposed at the crate root via
//! `#[path = "extensions/<name>.rs"] pub mod <name>;` declarations in
//! `src/lib.rs` and `src/ported/zle/mod.rs` so existing call-sites
//! that reference `crate::aot::`, `crate::completion::`, etc. continue
//! to resolve. Both paths point at the same file — they are aliases.
